From this link, it seems left join fetch is equal to eager

1. Address Eager & Email Lazy

    select
        employee0_.employee_id as employee1_2_0_,
        employee0_.employee_name as employee2_2_0_,
        employee0_.gender as gender3_2_0_,
        addresses1_.employee_id as employee3_0_1_,
        addresses1_.address_id as address_1_0_1_,
        addresses1_.address_id as address_1_0_2_,
        addresses1_.address as address2_0_2_,
        addresses1_.employee_id as employee3_0_2_
    from
        EMPLOYEE employee0_
    left outer join
        ADDRESS addresses1_
            on employee0_.employee_id=addresses1_.employee_id
    where
        employee0_.employee_id=?

when need to use email lazy, then fetch

    select
        emails0_.employee_id as employee3_1_0_,
        emails0_.email_id as email_id1_1_0_,
        emails0_.email_id as email_id1_1_1_,
        emails0_.email_address as email_ad2_1_1_,
        emails0_.employee_id as employee3_1_1_
    from
        EMAIL emails0_
    where
        emails0_.employee_id=?


2. select * from employee left join fetch email, email is lazy but use fetch can be get the data directly

Hibernate:
    select
        employee0_.employee_id as employee1_2_0_,
        emails1_.email_id as email_id1_1_1_,
        employee0_.employee_name as employee2_2_0_,
        employee0_.gender as gender3_2_0_,
        emails1_.email_address as email_ad2_1_1_,
        emails1_.employee_id as employee3_1_1_,
        emails1_.employee_id as employee3_1_0__,
        emails1_.email_id as email_id1_1_0__
    from
        EMPLOYEE employee0_
    left outer join
        EMAIL emails1_
            on employee0_.employee_id=emails1_.employee_id
    where
        employee0_.employee_id=?
Hibernate:
    select
        addresses0_.employee_id as employee3_0_0_,
        addresses0_.address_id as address_1_0_0_,
        addresses0_.address_id as address_1_0_1_,
        addresses0_.address as address2_0_1_,
        addresses0_.employee_id as employee3_0_1_
    from
        ADDRESS addresses0_
    where
        addresses0_.employee_id=?
